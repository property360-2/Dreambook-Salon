lets plan on making our school portal

ganto kasi yan eh
gusto ko maging scalable and maayus yung pagkakagawa nung system
there is an issue going to our school which nakakapag-enroll si student kahit meron inc from the past prerequisite, 
so kinuha akong project manager ng school namin
ganito magiging flow nung enrollment nyan
    if (new student ||  transfree || transfer from another course) {
        the user needs to input the credentials and pick the course he wanted
        if (student has inc && transferee || student has inc && transferee from another course) {
        he needs to go to registrar to pass the tor, then the registrar will manually give him elligible subjects
    } 
    if (new student) {
    the system wil give him the subjects eligible to take
    }
    fyi there should be continue button then a modal to show everything then inside that modal is merong confirm button tapos inside that modal is meron warning sign that he should carefully check the information before confirming

    upon confirming may lalabas na feedback from the system, showing the username and password generated by the system, the student can manually edit it in their ui
    }

    if( current student) {
    he dont need to fill up the form again, he just needed to login in his account then go to enroll subject page

    // inside the subject page
    if( has inc) {
    the system will show the only eligible subject he can take,}
    if (no inc) {
    almost the same as the with inc but there is no warning sign in the subject enrollment page
    }
    he can add more subjects basta di lalagpas ng 30 units    
    }
